This landscape is often described as technofeudalism, a system where tech giants act as modern feudal lords, controlling vast digital territories and extracting value from users through data and algorithmic control. To understand this complex system, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into its core components and explore historical parallels that can guide us toward a more equitable future.\nDefining Technofeudalism / Techno-colonization # Technofeudalism represents a post-capitalist structure where power is concentrated in platform ownership and data extraction rather than traditional capital. This system is characterized by cloud capital, where digital infrastructure serves as the new \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; monopolized by tech corporations. Instead of generating profits through production, these corporations extract what can be thought of as cloud rent, such as ad revenue and data fees. In this setup, users and workers become digital peasants, reliant on platforms for economic and social participation. The necessity of having a smartphone to fully engage in society underscores this dependency, making it difficult to imagine life without these digital tools.\nIn parallel, technocolonialism emerges as a modern iteration of colonialism, where control over technology infrastructure, data, and digital ecosystems is concentrated in the hands of a few global tech corporations, predominantly based in the Global North. This domination mirrors traditional colonialism, where economic, political, and cultural power was concentrated in the hands of a few nations, to the detriment of others. Technocolonialism involves the exploitation of digital technologies for political, economic, and social domination, often resulting in an unequal division of labor and dependency on digital infrastructure. It further exacerbates the disparities between the Global North and South, as developing countries become reliant on foreign technologies and data extraction systems, reinforcing their subordinate position in the global digital economy. Both technofeudalism and technocolonialism highlight how digital technologies can be used to exert control and influence over populations and resources, often in ways that mirror historical forms of exploitation.\nTechnofuedalism # Historical Context: The Luddite Revolution # An interesting parallel to our current situation is the Luddite Revolution in Western Europe during the early 19th century. Often misunderstood as anti-technology, the Luddites were actually pro-worker rights activists who targeted machinery that undermined their livelihoods. Between 1811 and 1816, they organized raids to destroy textile machinery, not because they opposed technology itself, but because these machines were used to exploit workers by reducing wages and increasing unemployment. The Luddites sought fair wages, safer working conditions, and protection against displacement by machines.\nParallels Between Technofeudalism and Industrial Exploitation # Today, we face a similar challenge. Our smartphones, the internet, browsers, and social media platforms are the modern equivalents of those textile machines. These technologies extract value from us—our data, attention, and labor—often without fair compensation or control over how they are used. Just as the Luddites smashed looms to reclaim their agency, we must find ways to resist the extractive forces of technofeudalism. However, unlike the physical machinery of the past, digital tools are deeply embedded in our daily lives, making traditional forms of resistance impractical.\nModern Resistance: Digital Literacy as Defense # In this digital age, digital literacy becomes our most powerful tool for resistance. It involves understanding how data is extracted, how algorithms work, and how platform monopolies operate. By being aware of these dynamics, we can begin to reclaim our agency. Digital literacy empowers us to use technology in ways that serve us, rather than just serving the interests of tech corporations. This might involve using encryption to protect our data, supporting open-source software, or advocating for policies that promote digital rights and fairness.\nConclusion: Reclaiming Agency in a Technofeudal Era # As we navigate this complex digital landscape, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that our goal is not to reject technology, but to ensure it serves humanity rather than just profit. Like the Luddites, we must focus on justice—demanding that technology empowers workers and users, not just the corporations that control it. By educating ourselves, advocating for policy reforms, and supporting grassroots tech initiatives, we can dismantle the extractive systems of technofeudalism and build a more equitable digital future. This journey requires collective action and a commitment to using technology as a tool for empowerment, rather than exploitation.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/technofeudalism/","section":"Docs","summary":"","title":"'Technofeudalism \u0026 Technocolonialism' What are they?","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Moss Oak Commons","summary":"","title":"About Us","type":"page"},{"content":" Test landing! # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Docs","summary":"","title":"Docs","type":"projects"},{"content":" The Hacker\u0026rsquo;s Manifesto # by +++The Mentor+++ Originally published in Phrack Issue #7, 1986.
